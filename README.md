# 🎈 Installation

Yah, it is as simple as the following 4 steps

1. Download a _.css_ theme file
2. (If you wish to change something, you can do so)
3. Upload the theme/skin to your device that runs _WLED_
4. Done.

If you came up with a really cool new Theme/Skin idea feel free to contribute to this repository so that others can use it as well 😄
